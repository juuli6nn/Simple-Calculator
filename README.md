Simple Calculator 4 Work Immersion
Please follow the following instructions:

1. Create a GitHub account. You may use your personal email address or your official UE email address.

2. Install git.

3. Create a folder and make it into a git repository using the respective git commands.

4. Implement a simple calculator in Python. The calculator takes in the following user inputs: two operands and one operator (+, -, *, /); after which it performs the operation and displays it to the user. Any other details not mentioned are up to you. You can implement validation, other operations, etc. Your implementation does not matter so long that it supports the basic features outlined above.

5. Try to make use of git features during your development. For example, commit after you've implemented user input; next, commit after you've implemented the calculation component; and lastly, commit after you've implemented how you'll present the answer. Using branches are not necessary due to the simplicity of the project, but you may experiment for the sake of learning.

6. Push your git repository to your GitHub account. You may freely decide about the repository name, description, README, etc.

7. Upload the link of the GitHub repository in the Google FormS.
